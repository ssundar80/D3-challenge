# D3 Challenge: Read All About It!!!

**Background**

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

**Tasks**
1) Create a D3 scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.
2) Include state abbreviations in the circles.
3) Create and situate your axis and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
4) Place additional labels into the scatterploct and give them click events so the user can decide which data to display.
5) Add a tooltip to the scatter plot

**Note**: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
